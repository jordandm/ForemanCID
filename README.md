# ForemanCID
Next Generation Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery Server with a Chef Inspired DSL

## Overview
ForemanCID is a Continuous Integration (CI) and Deployment (CD) server based on a Ruby DSL. Using the Foreman DSL you describe a 'recipe' for building a project.

The Foreman DSL is inspired by, and steals shamelessly, from the Chef DSL. This is intentional and
is done to make it easy for users of Chef to use ForemanCID and extend it.
